# Codespaces
We will use Codespaces to load everything you need to write and run your HTML code. Use the following steps to get started:
<ul>
  <li>Open the <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub Sign In page</a> and log into your GitHub account. </li>

  <li>Click the “Code” button and click on the “Codespaces” tab. </li>
  <li>Click the “Create codespace on main” button.</li>
  <br>

  <br><br>
  <li>It will take a few minutes to load! Wait for a pop-up box to appear in the bottom right corner asking if you want to install extensions. Then, click the “Install” button.</li>
  <br>
  <img src="/img/install-btn.png" width="50%">
  <br><br>
  <li>It will take a few minutes to install all extensions! It has finished loading once your screen reloads to show the "index.html" code and its output. 
</li>

# Codespaces Interface
On the left side, you should see an HTML file called “index.html” that you can edit directly by typing anywhere in it.

You can see the results of your HTML code on the right side. As you make changes to the “index.html”, you will see the results of your changes applied to web page in real time.
